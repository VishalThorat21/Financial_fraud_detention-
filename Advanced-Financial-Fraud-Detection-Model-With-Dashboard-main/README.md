Advanced Financial Fraud Detection System with Dashboard
Overview
The Advanced Financial Fraud Detection System with Dashboard is a comprehensive solution that combines machine learning models with a real-time monitoring dashboard. This project uses Power BI for dynamic visualizations, Scikit-learn and TensorFlow for detecting fraudulent activities, and Flask to enable real-time transaction analysis.

Key Features
Machine Learning-Driven Detection: Applies classification models to identify fraudulent transactions.

Dynamic Real-Time Analysis: A Flask-powered API facilitates live transaction monitoring.

Interactive Power BI Dashboard: Offers rich visuals highlighting fraud patterns and transaction behaviors.

Scalable and Modular Architecture: Designed for easy upgrades and additional integrations.

Technologies Used
Power BI: Employed for data modeling, visualization, and dashboard development.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized for complex calculations and KPI creation.

Power Query Editor: Used to clean and transform data efficiently.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and explore the Fraud Detection System:

Prerequisites
Power BI Desktop (latest version)

Python 3.x environment with required packages

A financial fraud dataset (available on Kaggle)

Setup Instructions
Dataset Download

Fetch the required financial fraud dataset from Kaggle.

Launch Power BI Desktop

Install Power BI if you don't already have it.

Import the Data

Navigate to Home > Get Data > CSV (or suitable format) and load your dataset.

Data Preparation

Use Power Query Editor:

Go to Home > Transform Data.

Perform necessary data cleaning and transformations.

Model Training and Deployment

Build and train models using Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

Deploy a Flask API to provide real-time predictions.

Dashboard and KPI Development

Create custom metrics using DAX:

Go to Modeling > New Measure.

Organize your visuals to design an intuitive dashboard.

Publishing Your Dashboard
To make your report accessible:

Save the Power BI project.

Click Home > Publish in Power BI Desktop.

Log in to your Power BI account when prompted.

Choose a workspace for publishing.

After publishing, access and share the report through the Power BI service either via a direct link or by embedding it elsewhere.
